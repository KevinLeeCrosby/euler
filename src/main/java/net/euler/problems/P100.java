/**
 * If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue discs and six red discs, and two discs were
 * taken at random, it can be seen that the probability of taking two blue discs, P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2.
 *
 * The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking two blue discs at random, is a box
 * containing eighty-five blue discs and thirty-five red discs.
 *
 * By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000 discs in total, determine the number of
 * blue discs that the box would contain.
